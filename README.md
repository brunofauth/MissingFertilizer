# MissingFertilizer
A spigot plugin which allows you to harvest and replant crops by right clicking them


### Works with
* Wheat
* Carrots
* Potatoes
* Beetroots
* Nether Wart
* Cocoa Beans


### Permissions
This plugin has separate "harvest" and "replant" permissions for each type of crop. They are all false by default BTW, using a permissions managing plugin, such as LuckPerms, is highly advised.


### Configuration
With this plugin, you can:
* enable/disable requiring tools to harvest/replant
* choose which are these tools (they can be hoes, axes, magma blocks, whatever)
* choose how much damage these tools will suffer when harvesting or when replanting separately


### Compatibility
This plugin is compatible with Spigot 1.15+ (perhaps it is compatible with as old of a version as 1.3, but I really don't feel like testing it. If you want you can change the target version on src/main/resources/plugin.yml before compiling it).



### Building it
Import this into IntelliJ idea and press Shift+F10


### What about that name?
When I used to play Tekkit Lite, there was this mod called MineFactory Reloaded, it included a trio of machines which worked together to get you the ultimate farming experience: the harvester, the planter and the fertilizer. This plugin can harvest and replant; however, the fertilizing experience is missing (you'll need to have bonemeal for that ;D ).
